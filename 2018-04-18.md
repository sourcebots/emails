Hello!

As the competition draws closer, it's time to release what is likely the final kit update before the competition itself. This release is a small one, but it's important you have updated to it before the competition.

# Changes
The largest change is the setting of your starting zone and mode using an additional USB drive. By default, your robot is in zone 0, and in development mode. With these USB drives, it sets your robot into competition mode, and correctly sets the starting zone for you when your match starts.

Access to the `zone` and `mode` is now correctly documented: https://docs.sourcebots.co./api/game-state/.

A more detailed changelog for this release is available from [the docs][dl-link].

To update your kit, you will need to flash your Pi's SD card. Instructions on [how to flash an SD card][sd-card-flashing], and the [download link][dl-link], are available from [the docs][updating-pi]. If you have any issues updating, be sure to consult [the documentation][docs], or contact us by [email][techsupport].

# Running Code before pressing the start button
Whilst this wasn't introduced in this release, we think it's important to highlight a fairly recent feature. Before, you were unable to run code before your start button was pressed. This feature is now documented and available to use: https://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/api/#running-code-before-pressing-the-start-button. This enables you to setup motors, servos, and other peripherals before your match starts, saving you valuable competition time!
