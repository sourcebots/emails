First of all, on behalf of everyone at SourceBots we would like to say a *massive* thank you for volunteering at the competition! This event could not run without you and we appreciate the hardwork and effort that you will put in!

Even though it is hard work, we can assure you that it will be a fun weekend filled with robot madness and making sure everything is running smoothly!

To that end, we thought now would be a good time write an email detailing information for the competition! :)
