First of all, on behalf of everyone at SourceBots we would like to say a **massive** thank you for volunteering at the competition! This event could not run without you and we appreciate the hardwork and effort that you will put in!

Even though it is hard work, we can assure you that it will be a fun weekend filled with robot madness and making sure everything is running smoothly!

To that end, we thought now would be a good time to send an email detailing information about the competition! :)

### Date and location

As a reminder, the competition dates are 21st April - 22nd April and it will be held in [The Cube (SUSU Building)](http://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/42.html).

### Schedule for the first day and scaff

Our arena will be built out of scaffolding and this will arrive on the 19th April. We will need help on the **20th April** to help set up the arena in the cube. Anyone that is avaliable should report to the cube where you'll be assigned tasks :)

For the first day, please meet in the [Mountbatten Building]() on **Level 4** at **0800**. Unfortunately this building does require card access so if you find yourself needing letting in please contact one of us. (What should I put here????)

### Pub 

On the sign up form, it was written that we will be heading to the pub for a meal on the **22nd April** the Sunday. We have chosen instead to this on the **21st April** as we will be very busy on the Sunday setting down the arena and may not get out of The Cube until late.

### Hats

Who said only robots are allowed to look swanky at the competition? Bring your best hat and wear it throughout the weekend!!
