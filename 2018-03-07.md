Hi!

We're happy to announce a new update to our kits!

# Kit updates
This release contains many improvements to vision:
- Completely redo vision to greatly increase its accuracy (now all Cartesian co-ordinates are within 15% of their distance from the camera, all angles are within 5 degrees)
- Greatly improve marker detection, it is now much less dependent on lighting conditions.

A more detailed change log for this release is available from [the docs](https://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/updates/mar-2018/).

To update your kit, you will need to flash your Pi's SD card. Instructions on [how to flash an SD card](https://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/kit/pi/sd-card/), and the related [download links](https://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/updates/jan-2018/), are available from [the docs](https://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/kit/pi/#updating-your-pi). If you have any issues updating, be sure to consult the documentation, or [contact us](techsupport@sourcebots.co.uk).

If you've updated your Pi before, you can install an update using [an update file](https://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/kit/pi/update-file/).
