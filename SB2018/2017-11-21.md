Hi,
I'm glad to say your team has been accepted for SourceBots, an independent effort to provide a replacement for Student Robotics 2018.
Here's a reminder of the key dates:
Kickstart:
Saturday, 16th December 2017, Starting at 10:00am
at the University of Southampton
In this event, we'll announce the game and give your team our robotics kits. We'll also host some challenges for the students to learn how to use their kits. There will be more details about this event in the coming weeks.
Although we strongly encourage you come to the event, we understand there might be issues with attending. If you cannot attend the Kickstart event, please tell us ASAP so we can start arranging for shipping the kits to you or arranging for you to pick kits up. (you will need to pay for any shipping if needed)
The Final Competition:
Saturday and Sunday 21st & 22nd April 2018 (dates are currently unconfirmed, do not make any permanent arrangements. We aim to confirm the date this month)
At the University of Southampton.
More information to come closer to the date.
One of the things we hope to do better than Student Robotics this year is interactivity, we hope to give you more regular updates on how things are going, and if you ever have any suggestions or questions, please contact me whenever you want.
