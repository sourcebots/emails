Hi!

We're happy to announce a new update to our kits!

# Kit updates
This release contains many improvements to vision:
- Completely re-do vision to greatly increase its accuracy (now all Cartesian values have an error within 15% of their total distance)
- Greatly improve marker detection, it is now much less dependent on lighting conditions.

A more detailed changelog for this release is available from [the docs](dl-link).

To update your kit, you will need to flash your Pi's SD card. Instructions on [how to flash an SD card](sd-card-flashing), and the [download link](dl-link), are available from [the docs](updating-pi). If you have any issues updating, be sure to consult the documentation, or contact us by emailing techsupport@sourcebots.co.uk
