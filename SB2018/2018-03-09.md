Hi!

We're happy to announce a new update to our kits!

This release contains many improvements to vision (other changes too):
- Completely rewrite vision to greatly increase its accuracy (now all Cartesian values have an tolerance of only 15% of their total distance).
- Greatly improve marker detection, it is now much less dependent on lighting conditions.

A more detailed changelog for this release is available from [the docs][dl-link].

To update your kit, you will need to flash your Pi's SD card. Instructions on [how to flash an SD card][sd-card-flashing], and the [download link][dl-link], are available from [the docs][updating-pi]. If you have any issues updating, be sure to consult [the documentation][docs], or contact us by [email][techsupport].
