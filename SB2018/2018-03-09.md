Hi!

We're happy to announce a new update to our kits!

# Kit updates
This release contains many improvements to vision:
- Completely re-do vision to greatly increase its accuracy (now all Cartesian values have an error within 15% of their total distance)
- Greatly improve marker detection, it is now much less dependent on lighting conditions.

A more detailed changelog for this release is available from [the docs](https://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/updates/mar-2018/).

To update your kit, you will need to flash your Pi's SD card. Instructions on [how to flash an SD card](sd-card-flashing), and the [download link](dl-link), are available from [the docs](the-docs). If you have any issues updating, be sure to consult the documentation, or [contact us by email](techsupport).
