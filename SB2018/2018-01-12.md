Hi all,

We hope you're progressing well on your robot!
We have some important things to announce, so keep reading:

## Mentoring

We're going to try and provide mentoring support for your team!

If you're interested in having a mentor come and help you, **reply to this email with the times your teams meet**, and we'll see if we can assign someone to you!

## Tech Days

We're happy to announce some tech days!

They'll be at the University of Southampton Electronics and Computer Science department in the Â£4 million electronics labs.

Tech days start at 10:00am and finish at 5:00pm, Tech days times where you can come to us for robotics advice or help with technical issues. You also get to see how other teams are doing. We typically give a tour of the university facilities during this time.
