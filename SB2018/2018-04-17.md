Hi All!

With less than a week to go with the competition, we'd like to give you the full details for turning up.

# Getting to the competition

I've attached a map of the event, it will take place in:

> Building 42
> University Rd
> Southampton
> SO17 1BJ

Also on the map is the recommended car park. This car park is free on weekends. Doors will open at 10:00am, and the introduction briefing is at 10:30am.

See https://sourcebots.co.uk/events/2018/competition/ for all the event details.

# Team name and photos
So we can display team names and robots on our score screens during the competition, we will need a team name and robot photo for each team.

Could you send us your chosen team name, and a photo of your robot. We would appreciate it if you could get this to us before the competition, so we can make sure your team and robot are correctly displayed. Both names and photos are entirely optional.
