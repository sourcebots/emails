Hi All!

With less than a week to go with the competition, we'd like to give you the full details for turning up.

# Getting to the competition

I've attached a map of the event, it will take place in:

> Building 42
> University Rd
> Southampton
> SO17 1BJ

Also on the map is the recommended car park. This car park is free on weekends.

All of these details are mirrored on our website: https://sourcebots.co.uk/events/2018/competition/.
