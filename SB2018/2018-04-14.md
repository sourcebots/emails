Hi all,

In order to be able to display teams and robots on our score screens during the competition, we will need a team name and photo from each team attending the competition.

Could you please send us your chosen team name and a photo of your robot in its current state. We would appreciate it if you could get this to us before the competition, so we can make sure your team and robot are correctly displayed.
