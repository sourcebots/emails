Hello!

First of all, a massive thank you for making SourceBots 2018, our first large-scale public event, such a success!

An article about the competition, results, and game has been [posted on our website](https://sourcebots.co.uk/blog/2018-04-23-noo-noo-from-collyers-college-wins-sourcebots-2018/), along with a [breakdown of the scores](https://sourcebots.co.uk/events/2018/competition#league-scores). Our photos of the event have also been uploaded to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/SourceBots/photos/?tab=album&album_id=207232630007360).
