Hi all,

Just a reminder and some information on the tech day we're running on Saturday (3rd feb)!

Tech days are a great opportunity for you to get robotics advice and help with technical issues from our volunteers. We may also have a tour of some university facilities as well.

## Location
The tech day will be held in [Building 25](http://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/25.html). There's a map attached which shows the recommended parking location.

The day will run from 10:00am until 5:00pm, however feel free to come and go as you please.

## Food
Food on campus is scarse, so we recommend either ordering in food, or bringing something with you. There are a few corner-shops located nearby however.

## Electronics
As expected, you'll need to bring your robot to work on, in whatever state it may be. We also recommend bringing at least 1 laptop with you to work on. Laptops can be provided, however this needs to be arranged with us in advance.

## Supervision
Team members must be accompanied by any adult who is able to take responsibility for all of them. (this would ideally be a teacher, but it can be a parent if all the other parents agree).

If you're planning on attending, be sure to let us know, so we know to expect you. If you're unable to make this tech day, there's not long to wait. Our next scheduled tech day is the 17th Feb!
