Hi all,

The competition is on! Thanks to those who were able to make it to Kickstart.

### The Game

The game has been announced, "Pirate Islands"!, The rules are available at http://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/rules/.

If we make any changes to the rules hereon, we'll be sure to email you.

### Competition

Weâ€™re still working as hard as we can on the date for the competition, There's something out of our control that we're trying to sort to get it confirmed. The current working date is still the 21st-22nd of April.

### Kits

The documentation for our kits are available at http://docs.sourcebots.co.uk/, if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to email me.

If you've already got your kits, read no further.

If you didn't pick your kits up at Kickstart, you can either arrange to pick up kits from us or we can ship them to you in the first week of January - we'll pay! Just let me know what you want us to do. Don't forget, you can get started on your robots without the kits.
