Hi all,

In order for anyone to attend the competition, a 'Media Consent' Form must be filled out. If students are over 16, they can fill out the forms themselves; however, if students are under 16, the form must be signed by their parent/guardian.

These forms must be filled out by all attendees and brought to the competition in order to gain entry.
Any additional guests can sign a form on the door as long as they're 16 or over.

It's important that the form is correctly filled out to ensure the line isn't held up at reception on the Saturday morning.
