Hi all,

In order for anyone to attend the competition, a Media Consent Form must be filled out. If students are over 16, they can fill out the forms themselves, however if students are under 16, it is a legal requirement that a parent/guardian signs the form for them.

These forms must be filled and sent to us to get a ticket for the competition, and to ultimately gain entry.

To submit a ticket just send me an email with an attached PDF of the tickets! We may reply with any errors we see.

Please try to get the tickets to us as soon as possible, as we'll be extremely busy organising the competition itself in the week before.
