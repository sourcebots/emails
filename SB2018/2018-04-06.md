Hi all,

In order for anyone to attend the competition, a 'Media Consent' Form must be filled out. If students are 16 or over, they can fill out the forms themselves; however, if students are under 16, the form must be signed by their parent/guardian. I've attached the form to this email.

These forms must be filled out, signed, and brought to the competition in order to gain entry.
We'll have extra copies of the form on the door for additional guests, though we encourage that everyone completes them ahead of time.

In order to ensure we can process arrivals smoothly, please ensure that everyone has completed Media Consent Forms before you arrive at the competition. If you are bringing any under 16s, please ensure that their parents or guardians have completed the proper sections as they may be denied entry if the forms are incorrect.
