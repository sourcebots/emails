Hi!

Some issues have come to light with [our rules][rules], and we've made some amendments:

## Amendment 1

The first amendment changes the IDs of marker tokens, as defined in section 3.1. This is of relevance to your team if they have hard-coded the IDs of the tokens from the rules.

The old marker numbers were as follows:

| Item                                    | Marker Number     | Marker Size      |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Arena boundary                          |     0 -- 27       |           250    |
| Columns                                 |    28 -- 43       |           250    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 0 |    **44 -- 49**   |           100    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 1 |    **50 -- 54**   |           100    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 2 |    **55 -- 59**   |           100    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 3 |    **60 -- 63**   |           100    |

The amended marker numbers are as follows:

| Item                                    | Marker Number     | Marker Size      |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Arena boundary                          |     0 -- 27       |           250    |
| Columns                                 |    28 -- 43       |           250    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 0 |    **44 -- 48**   |           100    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 1 |    **49 -- 53**   |           100    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 2 |    **54 -- 58**   |           100    |
| Tokens belonging to the robot in zone 3 |    **59 -- 63**   |           100    |

## Amendment 2

The second amendment fixes some ambiguity on the size of the scoring zones, as defined in section 3.2.11. This is of relevance to your team if they use the measurements of the arena to define the movement of the robot.

Previously, the specification in Section 3.2.11 did not match the arena layout in Figure 2, the specification states that the mscoring zones were squares of length 3m. When reading the figure, one could derive that the scoring zones are squares of 2.815m. The amendment changes the definition in the specification to match that of the diagram.

(This means the figure is not changed)

The old specification stated:

> 11. The scoring zones are squares of sides *3m* positioned with the columns separating
them

The amended specification states:a

> 11. The scoring zones are squares of sides 2.815mÂ±50mm positioned with the columns separating them.
