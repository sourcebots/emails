Hi!
With Kickstart on the 16th we thought we'd better update you on some more details about Kickstart.

Some of this information is different to Student Robotics - so read it carefully, **Anything you need to do in advance is in bold**.

## Kickstart Information

### Location and timing

Kickstart will be on Saturday the 16th of December from 10:00am (see schedule below) The intro talk will be in [EEE Building (building 32) of the University of Southampton][campus-map]

**If you can't attend, please email us so we can arrange for kit pickups/shipping and so we know how many teams to expect.**

To get to the University, you can either [navigate on Google maps][google-maps-campus] or follow the [guide on how to get to Highfield campus][how-to-get-to-campus], which gives public transport directions, too.

If you arrive on campus by vehicle, we recommend you park in the car park next to the intro talk, it is outlined on the [campus map][campus-map].

During the day we'll give out information on how to assemble the kits, important health and safety info and tips on how to build robots well. Don't forget you'll be taking your robotics kits home with you!

Then at the end of the day we'll host a workshop on how to assemble and program your robots.

### Important info

If you can, we encourage you to *bring a laptop* for the day to do some programming. If you can't bring a laptop, **Please message us by Thursday 14th so we can prepare a replacement!**

You should arrive with your competitors, as we'll be teaching them how to build and program their robots. However as volunteers we cannot take legal responsiblility for the students, so it is very important that your team arrives with an adult who assumes responsibility for every under-18 student that attends.

We will be taking a break for lunch at 12:00. Sadly we can't provide lunches, so you will need to either bring packed lunches or go and get some from the nearby stores/cafes. A [list of nearby food places][where-to-get-food] is available.

### Schedule for the day:

| Time        | Event              |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 10:00-11:30 |	Intro presentation |
| 11:30-11:45 |	Kit Handout        |
| 12:00-12:45 |	Lunch (BYO Lunch)* |
| 12:45-13:30 |	Game Announcement  |
| 13:30-18:00 |	Workshop           |

\*..or just get some from a [nearby shop][where-to-get-food]

(feel free to leave during the workshop if you finish all tasks, or need to leave early)

All of this information is repeated at [the event on our website][kickstart-2018] (the rest of the website is still being worked on!)

## The Competition

The pending date is the 21st April 2018, but don't make any permanent arrangements yet! We're working on confirming this as soon as we can.

We won't be able to provide team budgets this year. As this is the first time this programme has been run, we're on a tighter budget and sadly won't be able to provide some of the features you're used to.

We will try to provide mentoring this year. **If you're interested in signing up for some mentors to come help, send us an email!**

Tech days will be run throughout the competition at the University of Southampton. We'll try to confirm the dates at Kickstart.

You have only 4 months instead of the usual 6 this year, so make sure your team meets regularly to get stuff done on time!

That's everything!
