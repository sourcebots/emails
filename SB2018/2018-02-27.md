Hello all!

I'm happy to confirm the dates for the competition this year! The competition will be held from *Saturday 21st April* until *Sunday 22nd April*. The competition will be held at the University of Southampton's Highfield campus, so please plan accommodation / transport accordingly. The exact start/end times are to be confirmed, but it'll start at some point in the morning of the 21st, and finish in the afternoon of the 22nd, no later than 5:00pm.

This information will be reflected on our website soon!

## Competition Progress

You're now over half way through this competition period. Hopefully you're making good progress with your robot, and are well on your way to having something competition ready!

## Tech Days

There are just two remaining tech days between now and the competition. These are a great chance to spend a full day testing on your kit, and get direct support from us. The remaining tech days are:

- 17th March
- 14th April

Both of these are likely to be held at Highfield campus, as with the last two, however confirmation of this will come closer to the time.

## Media Consent
Media consent will be required to attend the competition. The forms for this will be sent through in the next week or two. These will need to be signed by each member of your team, as well as staff. Those under 18 will need a parent / guardian to sign on their behalf.
